Developed a complete, playable "Brick Breaker" arcade game from scratch, leveraging C++ and the SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library). This project was an amazing and insightful experience in game development, allowing me to implement core mechanics firsthand.

Key Features & Skills Applied:

Game Logic: Built the main game loop, managed game states (menu, play, game over), and controlled real-time player input.

Physics & Collision: Implemented precise collision detection between the ball, paddle, bricks, and screen boundaries.

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Applied OOP principles to create and manage game objects like the paddle, ball, and brick entities, making the code modular and scalable.

Graphics & Audio: Used SFML to handle all 2D rendering, sprite management, and sound effects.
